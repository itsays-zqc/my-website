## Introduction

<div class="text-justify">

&emsp;&emsp;The Y-junction splitter is a fundamental component of integrated optics. Its primary function is to split the incoming light from a single input waveguide into two separate waveguides (splitter). Likewise, it can also combine light from two waveguides into a single waveguide (combiner). 

&emsp;&emsp;The main performance parameters of the Y-junction splitter include **insertion loss**, **device dimensions**, *and **operating bandwidth**.

## Simulation Methods

<div class="text-justify">

&emsp;&emsp;Through the FDTD module or EME module, the Y-junction splitterâ€˜s structure can be optimized to obtain the transmittance of fundamental mode or S-parameters of each output port. This optimization process aims to improve the Y-junction splitter's insertion loss and bandwidth performance.
